# Pong-Game
A final project as part of SuaCode's Introduction to Programming (SuaCode 2020 cohort).
SuaCode is a platform to learn how to code with a phone offered by Nsesa Foundation.
I was privileged to be accepted into the 2020 cohort where I learned how to program with a mobile phone
and gained an understanding of variables, conditionals, functions and basic concepts in processing language.

In the end, the final project as a requirement was to combine all we learned to develop a pong game.
My project came with a colourful background and a sound effect. This set my interest in programming and
ultimately data science.
After peer grading, I was ranked in the top two (2) for my work. (https://twitter.com/suacodeai/status/1279502823928016902/photo/1)
